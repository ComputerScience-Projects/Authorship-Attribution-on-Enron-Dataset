You are going out wednesday and I leave for Ft. Kelly, I got you address from an e-mail from Meg and thought I would say hi. I have to run a bunch of errands today and pick up some decorations for my buddy's wedding this weekend so I can't go golfing. Maybe I'll work up the energy to go for a run later. I am definately going to go running now. Cowan says that K2 are really good and relatively inexpensive. Maybe I'll look for rollerblades when I'm out this afternoon. I was able to stay out of the bottle all weekend. Quite an accomplishment don't you think. I don't suspose you are working on the beautiful holiday monday but I just thought I would say hi. As soon as the Nymex settles I am getting out of here. Thanx for your help with my parking problem. I will contact Louis and hopefully he can take care of it. Can you give me a call sometime Tuesday afternoon. I can't seem to add any new products to my customer page. Mike Cowan said to drop you a line and have you clear the pages. The stag was a total monkey show. We played golf and pool, ate some dinner, took in the ballet and the hit the bars. I did manage to get a couple of rounds of golf in between all the drinking. I can't express to you how little I'm going to drink this weekend. I sent all of my Visa application information to Margaret by FedEx today. Just thought I would keep you in the loop! I accidentally deleted your e-mail from yesterday and don't remember any questions. I hadn't seen the jokes before but they were pretty funny. The others were pretty tasteless, so they were my favorites. I'm already getting psyched up for the weekend. My best friend's stag was on saturday and I still feel like shit. I guess I deserve it for drinking 200 beers. From what I recall I had a good time though. Mike and Andrew's group was by far the drunkest foursome. Dinner was good and then we went to the Sutter club to play pool. Call me tonight and I'll give you all the gory details. "Mr. Launer's tip for investors who don't have the time to do exhaustive research: Look for companies such as Enron and El Paso whose stocks are trading at price-earnings multiples that are lower than their long-term growth rates. " The one thing that scares me about Enron is the P/E, regardless of earnings growth. Our earnings growth has been so strong it is like a treadmill that keeps getting faster and faster. That being said, I have never sold a share of Enron stock or exercised an option. We always seem to find ways to reinvent ourselves and make money appear from nowhere. Investment in Enron should be treated with the same caution as investing in Cisco or any other new economy stock that challenges traditional valuation methods. Alan Wright not too sure about this one I cannot seem to suspend my product without hitting the red hand button not an option when I right click on the product and not red stop light. How are you doing? I had a great stampede but got a nasty cold. He went to Riverglen and is a pretty good friend of mine. Anyway, he is getting married August 12 so I've been pretty busy organizing his stag and getting ready for his wedding. Went to Red Deer this weekend and saw my parents. Did you know my brother moved to Toronto? I need to find a smaller place but for now I'm staying in Kensington. We should hit a patio and have a drink one night. I can't seem to suspend my product without hitting the stop sign with the hand on it. The red stop light isn't showing up and when I right click on the product the suspend product option is faded and I can't select it. I never get any good jokes which is why I haven't been sharing any. There aren't many weekends left in the summer and that sucks! Out of the weekends that are left I have two weddings and one stag, a trip to Houston and a trip to Toronto. gotta hop Rod, Thanx for booking those tee times. I left early yesterday and have been big time busy today. If not, would you like to come to Ryan's stag? You could play golf with Darryl Brown, Ryan's dad and their friend Dave. I think those guys are going to play golf and then come to dinner afterwards. How long does it usually take Blue Cross to refund for the flexible spending account? I sent in a claim form a month ago and haven't seen anything yet. The reason I'm concerned is that when my brother moved he did a change of address and my mail has been screwed up ever since. I can't just sit here and write e-mails all day.
