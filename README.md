#PAN 2019 Cross Domain Authorship Attribution

This repo contains the machine learning model which got the **2th** place to the [PAN19](https://pan.webis.de/) shared task *Cross Domain Authorship Attribution*.

After the competition a paper was published and presented at the [CLEF conference](http://clef2019.clef-initiative.eu/).
The model is based of a series of SVM's trained on different features, the predictions of those SVM's are combined through stacking. In the paper we explain the model we used in details, it can be seen for free at this [link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1ea5/8c961e94b642442b7dd8d4d88590f6c097ad.pdf).
